# 4.2 Underfitting & Overfitting

## Who will Repay Their Loans?

A lender hires you to investigate who will repay their loans

- You are given complete files on 100 applicants
- 5 defaulted within 3 years

A Surprising Finding

- All 5 people who defaulted wore blue shirts during interviews
- Your model leverages this strong singal as well

## Training and Generalization Errors

***Training error***: model error on the training data

***Generalization error***: model error on new data

Example: practice a future exam with past exams

- Doing well on past exams (training error) doesn't guarantee a good score on the future exam (generalization error)
- Student A gets 0 error on past exam by rote learning
- Student B understands the reasons for given answers

## Underfitting and Overfitting

## Model Complexity

The ability to fit variety of functions

- Low complexity model struggles to fit training set
- High complexity model can memorize the training set

It's hard to compare between very different algorithms

- E.g. trees vs. neural network

In an algorithm family, two factors matter:

- The number of parameters
- The values taken by each parameter

## Influence of Model Complexity

## Model Complexity Example: Decision Tree

The tree size can be controlled by the number of levels

- Use `DecisionTreeRegressor(max_depth=n)`in scikit-learn
- On house sales data:

## Data Complexity

Multiple factors matters

- number of examples
- number of elements in each example
- time/space structure
- diversity

Again, hard to compare among very different data

- E.g. a char vs. a pixel

## Model Complexity vs. Data Complexity

<img src="/Users/hanyixiao/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/截屏2021-12-02 20.32.02.png" alt="截屏2021-12-02 20.32.02" style="zoom:50%;" />

## Model Selection

Pick a model with a proper complexity for your data

- Minimize the generalization error
- Also consider business metrics

Start with pick up a model family, then select proper hyper-parameters

- Trees: number of trees, maximal depths
- Neural networks: architecture, depth(number of layers), width(number of hidden units), regularizations
