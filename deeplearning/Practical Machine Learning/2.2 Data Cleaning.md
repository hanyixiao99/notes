## Data Errors

- Data often have errors - the mismatch with groud truth
- Good ML models are resilient to errors
- Deploying these models online may impact the quality of the new collected data

### Type of Data Errors

- Outliers: data values that deviate from the distribution of values in the column
- Rule violations: violate integrity constraints such as "Not Null" and "Must be unique"
- Pattern violations: violate syntactic and semantic constraints such as alignment, formatting, misspelling

#### Outlier Detection

#### Rule-based Detection

- Functional dependencies
- Denial constraints 

#### Pattern-based Detection

- Syntactic patterns
- Semantic patterns

## Summary

Detect errors and fix errors by: model distribution, integrity constraints, syntactic/semantic patterns

Multiple tools exist to help data cleaning: Graphic interface for interactive cleaning, Automatically detect and fix
