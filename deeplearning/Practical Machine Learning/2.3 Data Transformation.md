# 2.3 Data Transformation

Data are transformed into forms appropriate for ML algorithms, we focus on methons in a particular step for various data types

## Normalization for Real Value Columns

- ***Min-max normalization:*** linearly map to a new min a and max b
  $$
  x_i = \frac{x_i - min_x}{max_x - min_x}(b-a) + a
  $$
  
- ***Z-score normalization:*** 0 mean, 1 standard deviation
  $$
  x_i=\frac{x_i-mean(x)}{std(x)}
  $$
  
- Decimal scaling

- Log scaling


  ## Image Transformations

- Downsampling and cropping
  - Reduce image sizes to save storage and for fast loading
  - ML is good at low-resolution images
  - Be aware of image quality
- Image whitening
  - Make input less redundant
  - Model converges faster

## Video Transformations

- Preprocessing to balance storage, quality and loading speed
- Often use short video clips
- Decode a playable video, sample a sequence of frames

## Text Transformations

- Stemming and lemmatization (a common base form)
- Tokenization ( text -> a list of tokens)
  - By word: text.split(' ')
  - By char: text.split('')
  - By subwords
