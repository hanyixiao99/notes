# 2.4 Feature Engineering

Machine learning algorithms prefer well defined fixed length input/output

Feature engineering (FE) is the key to ML models before deep learning (DL)

## Tabular Date Features

- Int/float : directly use or bin to ***n*** unique int values

- Categorical data: one-hot encoding

- Date-time: a feature list such as `[year, month, day, day_of_year, week_of_year, day_of week]`

- Feature combination: Cartesian product of two feature grds

  `[cat, dog] * [male, female]`

## Text Features

- Represent text as token features
  - Bag of words (BoW) model
  - Word Embeddings (e.g. Word2vec)
  - Pre-trained language models (e.g. BERT, GPT-3)

## Image/Video Features

- Traditionally extract images by hand-craft features such as SIFT
- Now commonly use pre-trained deep neural networks (ResNet, I3D)
