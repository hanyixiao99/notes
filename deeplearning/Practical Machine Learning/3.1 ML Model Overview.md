#  3.1 ML Model Overview

 

## Types of ML Algorithms 

### Supervised

Train on labeled data to predict labels

- Self-supervised(word2vec, BERT)

### Semi-supervised

Train on both labeled and unlabeled data, learn models to predict labels or infer labels for unlabeled data

- Self-training

### Unsupervised

Train on unlabeled data

- Clustering, density estimation(GAN)

### Reinforcement

Use observation from the interaction with the environment to take actions to maximize reward

## Components in Supervised Training

### Model

Output predicts from inputs

- Listing house to sale price

### Loss

Measure difference between predicts and ground truth labels

- (Predict_price - Sale_price)^2 

### Objective

Any function to optimize during training

- minimize the sum of losses over examples

### Optimization

Learn model parameters by solving the objective function

## Types of Supervised Models

### Decision trees

Use trees to make decisions

### Linear methods

Decision is made from a linear combination of inputs

### Kernel machines

Use kernel functions to compute feature similarities

### Neural Networks

Use neural networks to learn feature representations
