# 5.2 Bagging

**B**ootstrap **AGG**rgrat**ING**

- Bagging trains $n$ base learners in parallel
- Make decisions by averaging learners' outputs (regression) or majority voting (classification)
- Each learner is training on data by bootstrap sampling
  - Assume $m$ training examples, then ==randomly== sampling $m$ examples with replacement
  - Around $1-1/e(63\%)$ Examples will be sampled, the rest (out-of-bag) can be used for validation

## Bagging Code

```python
class Bagging:
  def __init__(self, base_learner, n_learners):
    self.learners = [clone(base_learner) 
                     for _ in range(n_learners)]
    
	def fit(self, X, y):
    for learner in self.learners:
      examples = np.random.choice(
      			np.arange(len(X)), int(len(X)), replace=True)
      learner.fit(X.iloc[examples, :], y.iloc[examples])
      
  def predict(self, X):
    preds = [learner.predict(X) for learner in self.learner]
    return np.array(preds).mean(axis=0)
```

## Random Forest

Use decision tree as the base learner

Often randomly select a subset of features for each learner

## Unstable Learners

Bagging reduces variance, especially for unstable learners

Consider regression for simplicity, given ground truth $f$ and base learner $h$, bagging: $\hat{f}(x)=E[h(x)]$

Given $(E[x])^2 \leq E[x]^2$, we have

- Bagging reduces more variance when base learners are unstable

## Unstable Learners

Decision tree is unstable, linear regerssion is stable

## Summary

Bagging train multiple learner on data by bootstrap sampling

Bagging reduce variance, especially for unstable learners
