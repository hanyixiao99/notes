# 1.3 Web Scraping

## Web scraping

- The goal is to extract data from website

- Many ML datasets are obtained by web scraping

- Web crawling VS scrapping  

  - Crawling:indexing whole pages on Internet
  - Scraping:scraping particular data from web pages of a website 

## Web scraping tools

- "curl" often doesn't work

- Use headless browser: a web browser without a GUI

  ```python
  from selenium import webdriver
  
  chrome_options = webdriver.ChromeOptions()
  chrome_options.headless = True
  chrome = webdriver.Chrome(
  	chrome_options=chrome_options)
  
  page = chrome.get(url)
  ```

-  Need a lot of new IPs,easy to get through public clouds

## Case study - house price prediction

- Query houses sold in near Stanford

  - Https://www.zillow.com/stanford-ca/sold/
  - Https://www.zillow.com/stanford-ca/sold/2-p/
  - ...

### Craw individual pages

- Get the house IDs from the index pages

  ```python
  page = BeautifulSoup(open(html_path, 'r'))
  links = [a['href'] for a in page.find_all(
  					'a', 'list-card-link')]
  ids = [l.split('/')[-2].split('_')[0]
        	for l in lins]
  ```

- The house detail page by ID

  - Https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/19506780_zpid/

### Extract data

- Identify the HTML elements through Inspect

  ```python
  sold_items = [a.text for a in page.find(
    'div', 'ds-home-details-chip')
                .find('p').find_all('span')]
  for item in sold_items:
    if 'Sold:' in item:
      reslut['Sold Price'] = item.split(' ')[1]
    if 'Sold on' in item:
      reslut['Sold on'] = item.split(' ')[-1]
  ```

- Repeat the previous process to extract other field data

## Crawl images

- Get all image URLs

  ```python
  p = r'https:\\/\\/photos.zillowstatic.com\\/fp\\/([\d\w\-\]+).jpg'
  ids = (a.split('-')[0] for a in re.findall(p, html)]
  urls = [f'https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/(id}-uncropped scaled within 1536 1152.jpg' for id in ids]
  ```

- A house listing has ~20 images

## Legal Consideration

- Web scraping isn't illegal by itself
- But should
  - NOT scrape data have sensitive information
  - NOT scrape copyrighted data
  - Follow the Terms of Service that explicitly prohibits web scraping
- Consult a lawyer if you are doing it for profit
