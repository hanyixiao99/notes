# 3.2 Decision Trees

 Classification tree & Regression tree

- Pros
  - Explainable
  - Can handle both numerical and categorical features
- Cons
  - Very non-robust(ensemble to help)
  - Complex trees cause overfitting(prune trees)
  - Not easy to be parallelized in computing 

## Random Forest

Train multiple decision trees to improve robustness

- Each tree is trained independently 
- Majority voting for classification, average for regression

Where is the randomness from?

- Bagging: randomly sample training examples with replacements
- Randomly select a subset of features

## Gradient Boosting Decision Trees

Tran multiple trees sequentially
