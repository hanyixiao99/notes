# 4.1 Evaluation Metrics

## Model Metrics

In supervised learning, we train models by minimizing the training loss

- The loss value is a widely used metric to measure model quality

There are many other metrics

- Model specific: e.g. accuracy for classification, mAP for object decetion
- Business specific: e.g. revenue, inference latency

We select models by multiple metrics

- Just like how you choose cars

## Case Study: Displaying Ads

Ads is one major revenue source for Internet companies

## Metrics for Classification

Accuracy: correct predictions / examples

`sum(y == y_hat) / y.size`

Precision: correctly predicted as class $i$ / predicted as class $i$

`sum((y_hat == 1) & (y == 1)) / sum(y_hat == 1)`

Recall: correctly predicted as class $i$ / examples in class $i$

`sum((y_hat == 1) & (y == 1)) / sum(y == 1)`

F1: Balance precision and recall

- the harmonic mean of precision and recall: $2pr/(p+r)$

## AUC & ROC

AUC, the area under ROC curve, measures the chance a model can distinguish classes

- Choose various $\theta$, predict as pos if $\hat y\ge\theta$ else neg

## Business Metrics for Displaying Ads

Optimize both revenue and customer experience

- Latency: ads should be shown to users at the same time as others
- ASN: average ads shown in a page
- CTR: user click through rate
- ACP: average price advertiser pays per click

Revenue = Page views * ASN * CTR * ACP

## Display Ads: Model to Business Metrics

The key model metric is AUC

A new model with increased AUC may harm business metrics

- it selects different ads to display, these ads may have
  - Lower estimated CTR
  - Lower real CTR because we only evaluated on past data
  - Lower prices

The solution is to deploy models to evaluate on real train data
