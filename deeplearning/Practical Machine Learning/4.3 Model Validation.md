# 4.3 Model Validation

## Estimate Generalization Error

Approximated by the error on a ==test dataset==, which can be only used once

- Your score on midterm exam
- The house sale price I bided
- Dataset used in private leaderboard in Kaggle

==Validation dataset==: can be used multiple times

- Often a part of the training dataset
- When we use "test", in most time we mean "validation"

## Hold Out Validation

Spilt your data into "train" and "valid" sets (often calls "test")

- Train your model on the train set, use the error on the valid set to approximate the generalization error

Often randomly select n% examples as the valid set

- Typical choices n = 50, 40, 30, 20, 10

## Split non I.I.D. data

Random splitting may not work

Sequential data: e.g. house sales, stock prices

- ==valid set should after train set==

Examples belongs to groups: e.g. photos of the same person

- Split among groups instead of examples

In-balanced data

- Sample more from minor classes

  

## Case Study on House Sales Data

Split by 50%, test both random and sequential splittings

## K-fold Cross Validation

Useful when ==not sufficient data==

Algorithm:

- Partition the training data into $K$ parts

- For $i = 1, ..., K$ Use the $i$-th part as the validation set, the rest for training
- Report the avaeranged the $K$ validation errors

Popular choices: $K$ = 5 (80%) or 10 (90%)

## Common Mistakes

Personal opinion: 90% super good results in ML are dut to bugs

- Contaminated valid set is the NO.1 reason

Valid set has examples from train set

- Duplicated examples in original data
- Often happen when integrating data
  - Scrape images from search engine to evaluate models trained on ImageNet

Information leaking

- Often happen for non I.I.D data: e.g. use future to predict past, see a person's face before
